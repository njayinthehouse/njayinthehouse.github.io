Sweeping Minesweeper to Make Mine
=================================

At the time of writing this article, Minesweeper lives 
[here](https://github.com/batfish/batfish/tree/master/projects/minesweeper).
For my Networks course, my team and I have chosen to reimplement Minesweeper
in Scala. I'm going to provide a quick introduction to Minesweeper here, and
talk about what I understand from sweeping through its code.

Background
----------

Minesweeper is a powerful network verification tool which is reported to 
achieve *high network design coverage* (i.e. support for various kinds of 
network topologies, routing protocols, etc.), *high data plane coverage* (i.e. 
can analyze a significant number (quantity?) of data planes), while remaining
scalable to real networks. The tool compiles network configuration files into
logical formulae that represent the network. Verification becomes the 
construction of SMT constraints using these formulae. SMT constraints are
expressive enough to warrant two concrete departures from prior literature:
(1) The could reason about graphs instead of just paths
(2) They could *combinationally search*, which allows them to abstract over 
    several possible tests and verify conditions for all of them at once.

The authors also propose two very simple optimizations which apparently make a 
very big difference in performance: slicing (i.e. dead code elimination?) and
hoisting (i.e. common subexpression elimination?). It is very surprising to me
that these optimizations make a difference, because I would think that Z3 
would perform similar optimizations on its own. However, I don't understand SMT
solvers well, so I need to check that belief. Another possibility is that the 
logical formulae that they use to encode networks doesn't map cleanly to SMT
constraints, though I don't see why that would be the case.

With this understanding, let's dive into the code and see what we find!

Code Sweep
----------

The first thing I see is that Minesweeper is still being actively developed on.
This is unfortunate, because there's no telling how much the architecture has
changed since the original paper in 2017. But that's not too bad, because I'd
prefer to structure our code very differently anyway, since we can enjoy the
benefits of FP in Scala. As long as the fundamentals are the same, that's all 
we need.

### Log
#### First Execution Attempt (Failed, but didn't try hard)

- I first tried cloning the batfish repository and opening it in IntelliJ. There
  are a couple of build problems that I don't understand, and I'm not sure if
  it's because of local problems or issues in the code (which is bleeding edge),
  last updated 22 hours ago).  
- I checked the tags on the repo. There's one called 2021-03-16-minesweeper.
  That sounds like a good place to start.
- Intellij still doesn't automagically build it. I might have to familiarize
  myself with Maven soon. But let's briefly skim the code first.

### Relevant points in the code

- `org.batfish.minesweeper.smt.Encoder` is used to interface with the SMT 
  solver.
- `org.batfish.minesweeper.smt.LogicalGraph` contains a wrapper on the network
  `Graph` with additional information about the routing protocols used in the
  `Graph`. I don't know what situations would require this.
- `Optimizations` does not have any mention of splicing and hoisting. :/


### Broad Strokes
#### Network Configuration File `->` Logical Formula

#### Logical Formula `->` SMT Constraints

#### Graphs

#### Combinational Search

#### Slicing/Hoisting
