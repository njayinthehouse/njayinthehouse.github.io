I've never been good at new year resolutions. That's something that I resolve to change. 
I want 2020 to be a good year for me. My first semester at Purdue gave me a glimpse of
how far I could go if I really tapped into this place, despite being a disorganized
emotional and professional mess. It took me two years before I really found my place in 
IIIT. I don't plan on waiting that long this time. 

If things go as planned, Gowtham and I will submit a paper in February, and another in 
May. I also want to be able to submit an original idea of mine to POPL in June. To come
up with this idea, I need to [read](/topics). I also need to write more; even stupid 
ideas need to be written as abstracts, and explored. If one of them pans out, nothing
like it. If not, at least I'll know why it can't.

I also plan to take at least one vacation per year, so I gotta save that money.
